		"119": "Being cursed was lonely, so I once made a friend out of leather. I named him Wilson.",
		"12": "The sun is high, but my prices are not.",
		"120": "Thank you for freeing me, human.  I was tied up and left here by the other goblins.  You could say that we didn't get along very well.",

		"122": "Now that I'm an outcast, can I throw away the spiked balls? My pockets hurt.",

		"176": "They say there is a person who will tell you how to survive in this land... oh wait. That's me.",
		"177": "You can use your pickaxe to dig through dirt, and your axe to chop down trees. Just place your cursor over the tile and click!",
		"178": "If you want to survive, you will need to create weapons and shelter. Start by chopping down trees and gathering wood.",
		"179": "Press {InventoryKey} to access your crafting menu. When you have enough wood, create a workbench. This will allow you to create more complicated things, as long as you are standing close to it.",
		"18": "Kosh, kapleck Mog. Oh sorry, that's klingon for 'Buy something or die.'",
		"180": "You can build a shelter by placing wood or other blocks in the world. Don't forget to create and place walls.",
		"181": "Once you have a wooden sword, you might try to gather some gel from the slimes. Combine wood and gel to make a torch!",
		"182": "To interact with backgrounds, use a hammer!",
		"183": "You should do some mining to find metal ore. You can craft very useful things with it.",
		"184": "Now that you have some ore, you will need to turn it into a bar in order to make items with it. This requires a furnace!",
		"185": "You can create a furnace out of torches, wood, and stone. Make sure you are standing near a work bench.",
		"186": "You will need an anvil to make most things out of metal bars.",
		"187": "Anvils can be crafted out of iron or lead, or purchased from a merchant.",
		"188": "Underground are crystal hearts which can be used to increase your max life. You can smash them with a pickaxe.",
		"189": "If you gather 5 fallen stars, they can be combined to create an item that will increase your magic capacity.",
		"19": "{PlayerName} is it? I've heard good things, friend!",
		"190": "Stars fall all over the world at night. They can be used for all sorts of useful things. If you see one, be sure to grab it because they disappear after sunrise.",
		"191": "There are many different ways you can attract people to move in to our town. They will of course need a home to live in.",
		"192": "In order for a room to be considered a home, it needs to have a door, a chair, a table, and a light source.  Make sure the house has walls as well.",
		"193": "Two people will not live in the same home. Also, if their home is destroyed, they will look for a new place to live.",
		"194": "You can use the housing interface to assign and view housing. Open your inventory and click the house icon.",
		"195": "If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to gather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!",
		"196": "For a nurse to move in, you might want to increase your maximum life.",
		"197": "If you had a gun, I bet an arms dealer might show up to sell you some ammo!",
		"198": "You should prove yourself by defeating a strong monster. That will get the attention of a dryad.",
		"199": "Make sure to explore the dungeon thoroughly. There may be prisoners held deep within.",
		"2": "Look at that shoddy armor you're wearing. Better buy some more healing potions.",
		"20": "I hear there's a secret treasure... oh never mind.",
		"200": "Perhaps the old man by the dungeon would like to join us now that his curse has been lifted.",
		"201": "Hang on to any bombs you might find. A demolitionist may want to have a look at them.",
		"202": "Are goblins really so different from us that we couldn't live together peacefully?",
		"203": "I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you go underground.",
		"204": "If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you might be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until night before using it, though.",
		"205": "You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before using it.",
		"206": "Demonic altars can usually be found in the corruption. You will need to be near them to craft some items.",
		"207": "You can make a grappling hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underground usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars or lead bars.",
		"208": "If you see a pot, be sure to smash it open. They contain all sorts of useful supplies.",
		"209": "There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazing things can be found deep underground!",
		"21": "Angel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer.",
		"210": "Smashing a shadow orb will sometimes cause a meteor to fall out of the sky. Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas.",
		"211": "You should focus on gathering more life crystals to increase your maximum life.",
		"212": "Your current equipment simply won't do. You need to make better armor.",
		"213": "I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a demon altar.",
		"214": "You will want to increase your life before facing your next challenge. Fifteen hearts should be enough.",
		"215": "The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified using some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives.",
		"216": "Your next step should be to explore the corrupt chasms.  Destroy any shadow orb you find.",
		"217": "There is an old dungeon not far from here. Now would be a good time to go check it out.",
		"218": "You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to gather twenty hearts.",
		"219": "There are many treasures to be discovered in the jungle, if you are willing to dig deep enough.",
		"22": "The last guy who was here left me some junk... er I mean... treasures!",
		"220": "The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for making weapons and armor.",
		"221": "When you are ready to challenge the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a living sacrifice. Everything you need for it can be found in the underworld.",
		"222": "Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!",
		"223": "Souls can sometimes be gathered from fallen creatures in places of extreme light or dark.",
		"224": "Ho ho ho, and a bottle of... Egg Nog!",
		"225": "Care to bake me some cookies?",
		"226": "What? You thought I wasn't real?",
		"227": "I managed to sew your face back on. Be more careful next time.",
		"228": "That's probably going to leave a scar.",
		"229": "All better. I don't want to see you jumping off anymore cliffs.",
		"23": "I wonder if the moon is made of cheese...huh, what? Oh yes, buy something!",
		"230": "That didn't hurt too bad, now did it?",
		"231": "As if living underground wasn't bad enough, jerks like you come in while I'm sleeping and steal my children.",
		"232": "Between you and me, {Dryad} is the only one I trust. She is the only one here who hasn't tried to eat me or use me in a potion.",
		"233": "I tried to lick myself the other day to see what the big deal was, everything started glowing blue.",
		"234": "Everytime I see the color blue, it makes me depressed and lazy.",
		"235": "You haven't seen any pigs around here have you? My brother lost his leg to one.",
		"236": "Everyone in this town feels a bit off. I woke up to the clothier chewing on my foot last night.",
		"237": "I'll give you a discount on your wears if you can convince {Truffle} to come over for a...sizing.",
		"238": "I feel like {Truffle} is a bit misunderstood, he really is a fun guy.",
		"24": "Did you say gold?  I'll take that off of ya.",
		"240": "I don't know the 'Truffle Shuffle,' so stop asking!",
		"241": "There's been such a huge rumor that's being spread about me, 'If you can't beat him, eat him!'",
		"242": "Oy, whatchu got in you jiminy fluffer?",
		"243": "Should I become an air pirate? I've considered becoming an air pirate.",
		"244": "Be it what it would, a jetpack would suit you nicely!",
		"245": "I'm feeling a bit peevish as of late, so enough with your palaver you ragamuffin!",
		"246": "I'm mighty curious about that {Cyborg} fellow. By what manner of consumption does he maintain such locomotion?",
		"247": "That captain fellow seems to me to be 'pretty well over the bay' if you know what I mean!",
		"248": "Show me some gears!",
		"249": "I like your... gear. Does it come in brass?",
		"25": "You better not get blood on me.",
		"250": "Once you enter hallowed land, you will see a rainbow in the sky. I can help you with painting that if you want.",
		"251": "Check out {PartyGirl}. Now that's a girl who can paint the town red!",
		"252": "I know the difference between turquoise and blue-green. But I won't tell you.",
		"253": "I'm all out of titanium white, so don't even ask.",
		"254": "Try swirly pink and purple, it works, I swear!",
		"255": "No, no, no... There's TONS of different grays! Don't get me started...",
		"256": "I hope it doesn't rain again until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!",
		"257": "I bring you the richest colors in exchange for your riches!",
		"258": "My dear, what you're wearing is much too drab. You absolutely must take a lesson in dyeing your tired attire!",
		"259": "The only kind of wood I would bother dyeing is RICH Mahogany. Dyeing any other wood is such a waste.",
		"26": "Hurry up and stop bleeding.",
		"260": "You must do something about {Pirate}.  Everytime he comes over here, it takes me a week to get the smell off!",
		"261": "Which doctor am I? The Witch Doctor am I.",
		"262": "The heart of magic is nature. The nature of hearts is magic.",
		"263": "{Nurse} may help heal your body, but I can make you embody healing.",
		"264": "Choose wisely, {PlayerName}, my commodities are volatile and my dark arts, mysterious.",
		"265": "We have to talk. It's... it's about parties.",
		"266": "I can't decide what I like more: parties, or after-parties.",
		"267": "We should set up a blinkroot party, and we should also set up an after-party.",
		"268": "Wow, {PlayerName}, meeting an adventurous man like you makes me want to party!",
		"269": "Put up a disco ball and then I'll show you how to party.",
		"27": "If you're going to die, do it outside.",
		"270": "I went to Sweden once, they party hard, why aren't you like that?",
		"271": "My name's {PartyGirl} but people call me party pooper. Yeah I don't know, it sounds cool though.",
		"272": "Do you party? Sometimes? Hm, okay then we can talk...",
		"273": "I'm no landlubber, but it's better to have lubbed and lost than never to have lubbed at all.",
		"274": "Yo ho ho and a bottle of....blinkroots!",

		"36": "I think you look better this way.",
		"360": "You would not believe some of the things people throw at me... Wanna buy some of it?",
		"361": "I'd lend you a hand, but last time I did that, I didn't get it back for a month.",
		"362": "Stay away from the spiders. They'll suck out your insides and leave you a hollow shell of a man. Trust me on this one.",

		"373": "Why don't YOU try collecting money from {Demolitionist} and not lose a hand or foot or...",
		"374": "I just came from {Merchant}'s. He wanted to know if I took credit cards.",
		"38": "MY GOODNESS! I'm good, but I'm not THAT good.",
		"380": "Here's your cut of the taxes that I've taken from our surplus population!",
		"381": "Here you are again, taking all my coin! Just grab it and begone from my sight!",
		"382": "Bah! Here, take your shillings and get out of my sight!",
		"383": "This is all you're gonna get for now, not a penny more! Take it and spend it wisely.",
		"39": "Dear friends we are gathered here today to bid farewell... Oh, you'll be fine.",
		"390": "...And people call me greedy? No, I have nothing else for you.",
		"391": "Oh, so you just see me as a coin sign, eh? 'Cus every time you see me, you ask me.",
		"392": "Don't you ever stop just to say 'Hi?'",
		"393": "Bah! You again? You just grabbed some of my coin just moments ago, so bugger off and come back later!",
		"394": "I just gave you half a crown five minutes ago! Scram!",
		"395": "Reaching into my moneybags again already!? And you call ME greedy.",
		"396": "You just received your pay, and not a farthing more! Get out!",
		"397": "Money doesn't grow on trees, so don't overpick my fruit! Bah! ",
		"398": "You already managed to spend every pence I paid you!? Bah, I'm not a charity, go kill a slime!",
		"399": "Not so fast! You got your money, now begone! ",
		"4": "Sword beats paper! Get one today.",
		"40": "You left your arm over there. Let me get that for you...",
		"400": "Begging so soon?! Don't look at me like I'll have a change of heart overnight! ",
		"401": "Make sure to smash any crimson altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!",
		"402": "Crimson altars can usually be found in the crimson. You will need to be near them to craft some items.",
		"403": "You can create a bloody spine with vertebrae. Make sure you are in a crimson area before using it.",
		"404": "I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a crimson altar.",
		"41": "Quit being such a baby! I've seen worse.",
		"42": "That's gonna need stitches!",
		"43": "Trouble with those bullies again?",
		"44": "Hold on, I've got some cartoon bandages around here somewhere.",
		"45": "Walk it off, {PlayerName}, you'll be fine. Sheesh.",
		"46": "Does it hurt when you do that? Don't do that.",
		"47": "You look half digested. Have you been chasing slimes again?",
		"48": "Turn your head and cough.",
		"49": "That's not the biggest I've ever seen... Yes, I've seen bigger wounds for sure.",
		"5": "You want apples? You want carrots? You want pineapples? We got torches.",
		"50": "Would you like a lollipop?",
		"51": "Show me where it hurts.",
		"52": "I'm sorry, but you can't afford me.",
		"53": "I'm gonna need more gold than that.",
		"54": "I don't work for free you know.",
		"55": "I don't give happy endings.",
		"56": "I can't do anymore for you without plastic surgery.",
		"57": "Quit wasting my time.",
		"58": "I heard there is a doll that looks very similar to {Guide} somewhere in the underworld.  I'd like to put a few rounds in it.",
		"59": "Make it quick! I've got a date with {Nurse} in an hour.",
		"6": "Lovely morning, wouldn't you say? Was there something you needed?",
		"60": "I want what {Nurse} is sellin'. What do you mean, she doesn't sell anything?",
		"61": "{Dryad} is a looker.  Too bad she's such a prude.",
		"62": "Don't bother with {Demolitionist}, I've got all you need right here.",
		"63": "What's {Demolitionist}'s problem? Does he even realize we sell completely different stuff?",
		"64": "Man, it's a good night not to talk to anybody, don't you think, {PlayerName}?",
		"65": "I love nights like tonight.  There is never a shortage of things to kill!",
		"66": "I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark.. You really don't want to know how it was made.",
		"67": "Hey, this ain't a movie, pal. Ammo is extra.",
		"68": "Keep your hands off my gun, buddy!",
		"69": "Have you tried using purification powder on the ebonstone of the corruption?",
		"7": "Night will be upon us soon, friend. Make your choices while you can.",
		"70": "I wish {ArmsDealer} would stop flirting with me. Doesn't he realize I'm 500 years old?",
		"71": "Why does {Merchant} keep trying to sell me angel statues? Everyone knows that they don't do anything.",
		"72": "Have you seen the old man walking around the dungeon? He doesn't look well at all...",
		"73": "I sell what I want! If you don't like it, too bad.",
		"74": "Why do you have to be so confrontational during a time like this?",
		"75": "I don't want you to buy my stuff. I want you to want to buy my stuff, ok?",
		"76": "Dude, is it just me or is there like a million zombies out tonight?",
		"77": "You must cleanse the world of this corruption.",
		"78": "Be safe; Terraria needs you!",
		"79": "The sands of time are flowing. And well, you are not aging very gracefully.",
		"8": "You have no idea how much Dirt Blocks sell for overseas.",
		"80": "What's this about me having more 'bark' than bite?",
		"81": "So two goblins walk into a bar, and one says to the other, 'Want to get a Goblet of beer?!",
		"82": "I cannot let you enter until you free me of my curse.",
		"83": "Come back at night if you wish to enter.",
		"84": "My master cannot be summoned under the light of day.",
		"85": "You are far too weak to defeat my curse.  Come back when you aren't so worthless.",
		"86": "You pathetic fool.  You cannot hope to face my master as you are now.",
		"87": "I hope you have like six friends standing around behind you.",
		"88": "Please, no, stranger. You'll only get yourself killed.",
		"89": "You just might be strong enough to free me from my curse...",
		"9": "Ah, they will tell tales of {PlayerName} some day... good ones I'm sure.",
		"90": "Stranger, do you possess the strength to defeat my master?",
		"91": "Please! Battle my captor and free me! I beg you!",
		"92": "Defeat my master, and I will grant you passage into the Dungeon.",
		"93": "Trying to get past that {WorldEvilStone}, eh? Why not introduce it to one of these explosives!",
		"94": "Hey, have you seen a clown around?",
		"95": "There was a bomb sitting right here, and now I can't seem to find it...",
		"96": "I've got something for them zombies alright!",
		"97": "Even {ArmsDealer} wants what I'm selling!",
		"98": "Would you rather have a bullet hole or a grenade hole? That's what I thought.",
		"99": "I'm sure {Nurse} will help if you accidentally lose a limb to these."
