		"193": "Two people will not live in the same home. Also, if their home is destroyed, they will look for a new place to live.",
		"194": "You can use the housing interface to assign and view housing. Open your inventory and click the house icon.",
		"195": "If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to gather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!",
		"196": "For a nurse to move in, you might want to increase your maximum life.",
		"197": "If you had a gun, I bet an arms dealer might show up to sell you some ammo!",

		"202": "Are goblins really so different from us that we couldn't live together peacefully?",
		"203": "I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you go underground.",
		"204": "If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you might be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until night before using it, though.",
		"205": "You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before using it.",
		"206": "Demonic altars can usually be found in the corruption. You will need to be near them to craft some items.",
		"207": "You can make a grappling hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underground usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars.",
		"208": "If you see a pot, be sure to smash it open. They contain all sorts of useful supplies.",
		"209": "There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazing things can be found deep underground!",
		"21": "Angel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer.",
		"210": "Smashing a shadow orb will sometimes cause a meteor to fall out of the sky. Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas.",
		"211": "You should focus on gathering more life crystals to increase your maximum life.",
		"212": "Your current equipment simply won't do. You need to make better armor.",
		"213": "I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a demon altar.",
		"214": "You will want to increase your life before facing your next challenge. Fifteen hearts should be enough.",
		"215": "The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified using some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives.",
		"216": "Your next step should be to explore the corrupt chasms.  Destroy any shadow orb you find.",
		"217": "There is an old dungeon not far from here. Now would be a good time to go check it out.",
		"218": "You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to gather twenty hearts.",
		"219": "There are many treasures to be discovered in the jungle, if you are willing to dig deep enough.",
		"22": "The last guy who was here left me some junk... er I mean... treasures!",
		"220": "The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for making weapons and armor.",
		"221": "When you are ready to challenge the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a living sacrifice. Everything you need for it can be found in the underworld.",
		"222": "Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!",
		"223": "Souls can sometimes be gathered from fallen creatures in places of extreme light or dark.",
		"224": "Ho ho ho, and a bottle of... Egg Nog!",
		"225": "Care to bake me some cookies?",
		"226": "What? You thought I wasn't real?",
		"227": "I managed to sew your face back on. Be more careful next time.",

		"23": "I wonder if the moon is made of cheese...huh, what? Oh yes, buy something!",
		"230": "That didn't hurt too bad, now did it?",
		"231": "As if living underground wasn't bad enough, jerks like you come in while I'm sleeping and steal my children.",
		"232": "Between you and me, {Dryad} is the only one I trust. She is the only one here who hasn't tried to eat me or use me in a potion.",

		"243": "Should I become an air pirate? I've considered becoming an air pirate.",
		"244": "Be it what it would, a jetpack would suit you nicely!",
		"245": "I'm feeling a bit peevish as of late, so enough with your palaver you ragamuffin!",
		"246": "I'm mighty curious about that {Cyborg} fellow. By what manner of consumption does he maintain such locomotion?",
		"247": "That captain fellow seems to me to be 'pretty well over the bay' if you know what I mean!",
		"248": "Show me some gears!",
		"249": "I like your... gear. Does it come in brass?",

		"252": "I know the difference between turquoise and blue-green. But I won't tell you.",
		"253": "I'm all out of titanium white, so don't even ask.",
		"254": "Try swirly pink and purple, it works, I swear!",
		"255": "No, no, no... There's TONS of different grays! Don't get me started...",
		"256": "I hope it doesn't rain again until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!",

		"350": "I hate blood moons! I stay up all night because of all the scary noises!",
		"351": "Blood moon is the worst time to fish! The fish bite, yes, but so do the zombies!",
		"352": "There's a bajillion monsters running around out there right now!",
		"353": "Thanks, I guess, for saving me or whatever. You'd be a great helper minion!",

		"36": "I think you look better this way.",
		"360": "You would not believe some of the things people throw at me... Wanna buy some of it?",
		"361": "I'd lend you a hand, but last time I did that, I didn't get it back for a month.",

		"373": "Why don't YOU try collecting money from {Demolitionist} and not lose a hand or foot or...",
		"374": "I just came from {Merchant}'s. He wanted to know if I took credit cards.",
		"38": "MY GOODNESS! I'm good, but I'm not THAT good.",
		"380": "Here's your cut of the taxes that I've taken from our surplus population!",
		"381": "Here you are again, taking all my coin! Just grab it and begone from my sight!",
		"382": "Bah! Here, take your shillings and get out of my sight!",
		"383": "This is all you're gonna get for now, not a penny more! Take it and spend it wisely.",
		"39": "Dear friends we are gathered here today to bid farewell... Oh, you'll be fine.",
		"390": "...And people call me greedy? No, I have nothing else for you.",
		"391": "Oh, so you just see me as a coin sign, eh? 'Cus every time you see me, you ask me.",
		"392": "Don't you ever stop just to say 'Hi?'",
		"393": "Bah! You again? You just grabbed some of my coin just moments ago, so bugger off and come back later!",
		"394": "I just gave you half a crown five minutes ago! Scram!",
		"395": "Reaching into my moneybags again already!? And you call ME greedy.",
		"396": "You just received your pay, and not a farthing more! Get out!",
		"397": "Money doesn't grow on trees, so don't overpick my fruit! Bah! ",
		"398": "You already managed to spend every pence I paid you!? Bah, I'm not a charity, go kill a slime!",
		"399": "Not so fast! You got your money, now begone! ",
		"4": "Sword beats paper! Get one today.",
		"40": "You left your arm over there. Let me get that for you...",
		"400": "Begging so soon?! Don't look at me like I'll have a change of heart overnight! ",
		"401": "Make sure to smash any crimson altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!",
		"402": "Crimson altars can usually be found in the crimson. You will need to be near them to craft some items.",
		"403": "You can create a bloody spine with vertebrae. Make sure you are in a crimtane area before using it.",
		"41": "Quit being such a baby! I've seen worse.",
		"42": "That's gonna need stitches!",
		"43": "Trouble with those bullies again?",
		"44": "Hold on, I've got some cartoon bandages around here somewhere.",
		"45": "Walk it off, {PlayerName}, you'll be fine. Sheesh.",
		"46": "Does it hurt when you do that? Don't do that.",
		"47": "You look half digested. Have you been chasing slimes again?",
		"48": "Turn your head and cough.",
		"49": "That's not the biggest I've ever seen... Yes, I've seen bigger wounds for sure.",
		"5": "You want apples? You want carrots? You want pineapples? We got torches.",
		"50": "Would you like a lollipop?",
		"51": "Show me where it hurts.",
		"52": "I'm sorry, but you can't afford me.",
		"53": "I'm gonna need more gold than that.",
		"54": "I don't work for free you know.",
		"55": "I don't give happy endings.",
		"56": "I can't do anymore for you without plastic surgery.",
		"57": "Quit wasting my time.",
		"58": "I heard there is a doll that looks very similar to {Guide} somewhere in the underworld.  I'd like to put a few rounds in it.",
		"59": "Make it quick! I've got a date with {Nurse} in an hour.",
		"6": "Lovely morning, wouldn't you say? Was there something you needed?",
		"60": "I want what {Nurse} is sellin'. What do you mean, she doesn't sell anything?",
		"61": "{Dryad} is a looker.  Too bad she's such a prude.",
		"62": "Don't bother with {Demolitionist}, I've got all you need right here.",
		"63": "What's {Demolitionist}'s problem? Does he even realize we sell completely different stuff?",
		"64": "Man, it's a good night not to talk to anybody, don't you think, {PlayerName}?",
		"65": "I love nights like tonight.  There is never a shortage of things to kill!",
		"66": "I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark.. You really don't want to know how it was made.",
		"67": "Hey, this ain't a movie, pal. Ammo is extra.",
		"68": "Keep your hands off my gun, buddy!",
		"69": "Have you tried using purification powder on the ebonstone of the corruption?",
		"7": "Night will be upon us soon, friend. Make your choices while you can.",
		"70": "I wish {ArmsDealer} would stop flirting with me. Doesn't he realize I'm 500 years old?",
		"71": "Why does {Merchant} keep trying to sell me an angel statues? Everyone knows that they don't do anything.",
		"72": "Have you seen the old man walking around the dungeon? He doesn't look well at all...",
		"73": "I sell what I want! If you don't like it, too bad.",
		"74": "Why do you have to be so confrontational during a time like this?",
		"75": "I don't want you to buy my stuff. I want you to want to buy my stuff, ok?",
		"76": "Dude, is it just me or is there like a million zombies out tonight?",
		"77": "You must cleanse the world of this corruption.",
		"78": "Be safe; Terraria needs you!",
		"79": "The sands of time are flowing. And well, you are not aging very gracefully.",
		"8": "You have no idea how much Dirt Blocks sell for overseas.",
		"80": "What's this about me having more 'bark' than bite?",
		"81": "So two goblins walk into a bar, and one says to the other, 'Want to get a Goblet of beer?!",
		"82": "I cannot let you enter until you free me of my curse.",
		"83": "Come back at night if you wish to enter.",
		"84": "My master cannot be summoned under the light of day.",
		"85": "You are far too weak to defeat my curse.  Come back when you aren't so worthless.",
		"86": "You pathetic fool.  You cannot hope to face my master as you are now.",
		"87": "I hope you have like six friends standing around behind you.",
		"88": "Please, no, stranger. You'll only get yourself killed.",
		"89": "You just might be strong enough to free me from my curse...",
		"9": "Ah, they will tell tales of {PlayerName} some day... good ones I'm sure.",
		"90": "Stranger, do you possess the strength to defeat my master?",
		"91": "Please! Battle my captor and free me! I beg you!",
		"92": "Defeat my master, and I will grant you passage into the Dungeon.",
		"93": "Trying to get past that ebonrock, eh?  Why not introduce it to one of these explosives!",
		"94": "Hey, have you seen a clown around?",
		"95": "There was a bomb sitting right here, and now I can't seem to find it...",
		"96": "I've got something for them zombies alright!",
		"97": "Even {ArmsDealer} wants what I'm selling!",
		"98": "Would you rather have a bullet hole or a grenade hole? That's what I thought.",
		"99": "I'm sure {Nurse} will help if you accidentally lose a limb to these."
